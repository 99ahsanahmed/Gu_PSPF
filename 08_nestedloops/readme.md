### Task 2: Holiday Gift Shop (Bonus Question) üéÅ
Problem Statement: A gift shop is organizing its display where:
‚óè There are 3 shelves.
‚óè Each shelf has 3 sections.
‚óè Each section can hold 2 gifts.
‚óè The base price for each gift is $5.
‚óè The price for each shelf increases by $3 for each additional shelf (Shelf 1: $5, Shelf 2:
$8, Shelf 3: $11).
‚óè The price for each section increases by $1 for each additional section (Section 1: $1,
Section 2: $2, Section 3: $3).
You need to create a program that calculates and displays the price of each gift in each section
for each shelf. The gift price is calculated as:
Gift Price = Base Price + Shelf Price + Section Price
Hints:
1. Base Price: This is fixed at $5 for all gifts.
2. Shelf Price: The price for each shelf starts at $5 for Shelf 1.
For each subsequent shelf, increase the shelf price by $3.
For example, Shelf 1 has a price of $5, Shelf 2 has a price of $8, and Shelf 3 has a
price of $11.
‚óã Hint: After printing the details for each shelf, add 3 to the shelf price for the next
shelf.

3. Section Price: The price for each section starts at $1 for Section 1.
For each subsequent section on the same shelf, increase the section price by $1. For
example, Section 1 has a price of $1, Section 2 has a price of $2, and Section 3 has a
price of $3.
‚óã Hint: After printing the details for each section, add 1 to the section price for the
next section on the same shelf.
